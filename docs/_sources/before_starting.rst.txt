Staying safe
------------

You should be aware of and familiarise yourself with any potential hazards involved in making a bike generator. Ensure you are working in a suitable environment - work indoors on a stable, clear surface, and make sure any trip hazards from trailing cables are cleared away. 

When working with power tools - drills, jigsaws, etc - always use them properly to avoid the risk of harm or injury. Make sure the tools are all in good working condition, switch off and disconnect tools when not using them, and wear suitable protective equipment (safety glasses, gloves, etc) and avoid loose clothing or accessories that can get caught in moving parts.
